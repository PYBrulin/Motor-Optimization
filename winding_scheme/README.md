# Winding Scheme

The following images are generated using the Winding Scheme Calculator available at: https://www.bavaria-direct.co.za/scheme/calculator/

The python script `winding_scheme.py` is able to calculate the slot/magnet pole combination of the given configuration.
will have 12 cogging steps per turn. LCM(6,4)
And its winding factor is: 0.86603

## Notes :

> Winding Factor is the product of the Distribution factor (Kd) and the coil span factor (Kc). The main purpose of the winding factor is to improve the rms generated voltage in a three-phase AC machine. [[ref]](https://www.electricalvolt.com/2021/11/winding-factor/)

> The ratio of phasor (vector) sum of induced emfs per coil to the arithmetic sum of induced emfs per coil is known as pitch factor (Kp) or coil span factor (Kc) which is always less than unity. [[ref]](https://uotechnology.edu.iq/dep-eee/lectures/3rd/Electrical/Machines%202/I_Introduction.pdf)
